# What is DataV? {#concept_rbr_xjj_p2b .concept}

DataV is an Alibaba Cloud data visualization tool that displays data in a more user-friendly way. Through using DataV, you can gain insights into complex and dynamic business data in real time, while also learning about business obstacles and opportunities by using interactive video walls. DataV can be used in a great variety of industries including, but not limited to, retail, transportation, logistics, electric power, water conservation, and even environmental protection.

Traditionally, when creating a visualization project, you may encounter the following challenges:

-   The visualization of complex data may pose processing difficulties.
-   Developing charts and visual effects is time consuming.
-   Necessary components or tools for presenting and analyzing non-traditional data, such as spatio-temporal or relational data, are not easily accessible or available for use.
-   The target presentation screens do not support the required display resolution necessary for big data visualizations.
-   Existing visualization tools are not designed to present visualizations based on big data analytics.

DataV provides various visualization templates, which can help non-technical personnel be able to create professional-level data visualization projects directly by using the DataV console. In other words, various data presentation requirements, such as exhibitions, business monitoring, risk warning, and geographic information analysis, can be met by using DataV.
