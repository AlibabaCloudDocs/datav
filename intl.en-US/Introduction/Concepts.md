## Visualization projects, applications, and dashboards {#section_pk4_mrj_p2b .section}

The presentation of data generated by DataV in dashboards is known as a visualization project. It is also called as a visualization application or a large screen project. DataV is a tool that converts data into various charts and maps in order to present data to users dynamically and in real time.

## Data sources {#section_pgb_qrj_p2b .section}

When you create a large screen project with DataV, you must specify the source of the original data. Data sources used with DataV can include the following:

-   Database
-   Static data
-   API
-   Others

For more information about adding a data source, see [Add a Data Source](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Manage data sources/Add data sources/Overview.md#).

## Canvas {#section_ns2_srj_p2b .section}

A canvas is also called an interface editor and is the main functional area of DataV. You can adjust settings like layouts and colors for a project, bind data sources with charts, and publish various applications in a canvas.
