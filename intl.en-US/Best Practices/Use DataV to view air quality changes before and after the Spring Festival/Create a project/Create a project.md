**Note:** The data source used in this example is a local API file. Therefore, you do not need to add a data source. You can directly call the API from the widgets of the project. To use another data source, you must add the data source to DataV before you can create a project.

1.  Log on to the [DataV console](https://datav.aliyun.com/).
2.  Choose **Projects** \> **Create Project**.
3.  Select the blank template and click **Create**.
