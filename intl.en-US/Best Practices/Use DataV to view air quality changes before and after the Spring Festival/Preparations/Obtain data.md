# Obtain data {#concept_s55_ptq_p2b .concept}

This topic describes how to obtain air quality data before and after the Spring Festival. You need to obtain the data first before you can process the data.

You can download data from [historical air quality data](http://beijingair.sinaapp.com/?spm=5176.100239.blogcont69319.19.kb5QDK).

**Note:** We recommend that you download the files in CSV format.

In this example, the data is obtained from 1,497 monitoring sites from the dates of January 1, 2017 to February 2, 2017.

Open the downloaded files and check whether the data needs to be supplemented or filtered.
