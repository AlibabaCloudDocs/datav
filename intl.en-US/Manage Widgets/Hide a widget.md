# Hide a widget

You can hide one or more widgets that are configured to clear up the screen. This allows you to improve the efficiency to develop your project.

Hiding a widget allows you to achieve the following results:

-   A map widget occupies too many CPU and memory resources, so the editor responds slowly. To resolve this issue, you can hide the widget to reduce workloads on computing resources and facilitate the deployment of other widgets.
-   You can hide a configured widget to clear up the screen and improve efficiency.

1.  Log on to the [DataV console](https://datav.alibabacloud.com/).

2.  On the **Projects** page, click the project that you create.

    If you have not created a project, see [Create a project by using a template](/intl.en-US/Manage Projects/Create a project.md).

3.  In the canvas editor, click a widget in the **Layer** pane or on the canvas.

    **Note:** If you have not added widgets to the canvas, see [Add a widget](/intl.en-US/Manage Widgets/Add a widget.md).

4.  Right-click the widget and select **Hide** or click the ![Hide icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5811630161/p9226.png) icon in the lower part of the Layer pane.

    The hidden widget is listed in the **Layer** panel on the left with a Hide icon and is dimmed.
