# Renewal and expiration rules

After your DataV instance expires, it cannot be used. The system sends you a notification for renewing the instance. In this case, renew your DataV instance to ensure service availability.

## Expiration

After your DataV instance expires, the system sends text messages or other notifications to you. Your DataV instance is retained for 15 days after the expiration. If you renew the DataV instance within this retention period, your DataV instance is not affected. After 15 days, the instance will be destroyed and can no longer be renewed.

**Note:** The price of a renewal for the same period may differ from the original price because of promotions on Alibaba Cloud. For example, some promotions are available only at renewals.
