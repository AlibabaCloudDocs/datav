# Overdue payment and renewal

The system may send you notifications that you have overdue payments. When this occurs, please clear all overdue payments to avoid instances being released. Please note that your instances may be released at a system-selected time after the payment due date.

## Overdue payment

When your DataV instance expires, the system sends you an SMS notification. Your DataV instance and projects are retained for 15 days after the expiration. If you renew the DataV instance within this retention period, your DataV instance and projects are not affected.

If you do not renew the instance within the retention period, your DataV instance is destroyed.

**Note:** The price of a renewal for the same duration may differ from the original price because of promotions on Alibaba Cloud. For example, some promotions are available only at renewals.

## Renew the DataV instance

1.  Log on to the [DataV console](https://datav.alibabacloud.com/).

2.  Move the pointer over the username in the upper-right corner and select **Renew**. The **Renew** page appears.
