# Overview

This topic provides an overview of files used to develop DataV widgets.

Before you develop widgets, you must create a folder to serve as the widget package. We recommend that you use the widget name to name the package. A widget package contains the following files.

|File|Description|
|----|-----------|
|index.js|The API of the widget.|
|package.json|The settings of the widget.|
|readme.md|The description of the widget.|
|history.md|The update history of the widget.|
