# Configure item description {#concept_lsz_bc4_t2b .concept}

Click a widget on the canvas. The configuration panel appears on the right-side of the canvas. The panel includes three tabs:Style, Data, and Interaction.

Configuration items are collapsed and grouped based on different levels. The Style tab displays **Basic Attributes**. Other content is collapsed to make the item structure more clear and ease classification and searches.

The following example uses a line chart.
