# Group widgets {#concept_nwy_lfh_t2b .concept}

You can **group** or **ungroup** multiple widgets within a project.

## Group {#section_br3_vfh_t2b .section}

1.  Log on to the [DataV console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/datav).
2.  Select a project to go to the project page.
3.  In the left-side Layerspane or on the canvas, hold down **Ctrl** for Windows \(hold down **Command** for **Mac**\) and click multiple widgets to select the required amount of widgets.

    Move the pointer over the selected widgets to move the widgets simultaneously.

4.  Right-click and choose **Group** \(or click the ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/17377/15583439859224_en-US.png) icon at the bottom of the **Layers** list\) to group the selected widgets to a group file.

## Ungroup {#section_osh_lhh_t2b .section}

1.  Right-click a group file.
2.  Choose **Ungroup**.

    **Note:** In the **Layers** list or on the canvas, select one or more widgets, use the new shortcut key **Ctrl + G** for grouping, and **CTRL + Shift + G** for ungrouping.

    When you click **Ungroup**, all the widgets in the group file return to an ungrouped state. Widgets are then independent of each other, and can no longer be moved simultaneously.
