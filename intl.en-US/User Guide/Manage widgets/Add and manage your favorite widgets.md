# Add and manage your favorite widgets {#concept_vsp_fwt_qfb .concept}

This topic describes how to add a widget to your favorites, and how to view, rename, use, and delete favorite widgets.

**Note:** If you are using the basic edition of DataV, no widgets can be added to your favorites. If you are using the enterprise edition, 20 widgets can be added to your favorites. If you are using the developer version, 40 widgets can be added to your favorites.

## Procedure {#section_zvg_kvm_q2b .section}

1.  Log on to the [DataV console](https://datav.alibabacloud.com/).
2.  On the **Projects** tab page, click **Create Project**, select a template, and then click **Create**.

    **Note:** You can also select an existing project on the **Projects** tab page.

3.  Add a widget to your favorites.
    1.  In the **Layers** pane on the left, or in the dashboard \(the center blue area on the page\), select a widget.

        **Note:** If you are using the enterprise edition of DataV, you can select only one widget at a time to add it to your favorites.

    2.  Right-click the widget and then click **Favorite** to add it to your favorites.

        **Note:** The data indicated by the widget can be affected by the data source changes. Therefore, we recommend that you use static data when you add a widget to your favorites.

## Add widgets to your favorites by group {#section_rtc_stw_dhb .section}

You can group your widgets and add them to your favorites for later use.

The Group function helps you add more widgets to your favorites.

**Note:** The Group function is only available in the **developer** edition of DataV. To use this function, you must upgrade your DataV to the developer edition.

**Procedure**

1.  In the **Layers** pane on the left, or in the dashboard \(the center blue area on the page\), select two or more widgets as needed.
2.  Right-click the selected widgets and select **Group**.
3.  In the **Layers** pane on the left, or in the dashboard \(the center blue area on the page\), select the grouped widgets.
4.  Right-click the widgets and select **Favorite**.

    **Note:** Changing the data sources of your favorite widgets might cause the widgets to become unavailable. Therefore, we recommend you use static data when you add widgets to your favorites.
