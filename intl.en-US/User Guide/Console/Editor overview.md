-   Page size

    You can set the screen resolution in the Page Size field. The default resolution is 1920 x 1080.

-   Background image

    You can upload an image of up to 1 MB as the background of a project.

    If your project cannot be displayed on standard screen sizes, we recommend that you use **Full Screen** mode.
