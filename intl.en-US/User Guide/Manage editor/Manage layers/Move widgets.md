## Functions of widget layer movement {#section_wwp_vjh_t2b .section}

The movement of widget layers can make the ordering of widgets more organized on a large screen.

-   The higher a widget is positioned in the list, the closer it is to the front of the canvas.
-   The lower a widget is positioned in the list, the closer it is to the back of the canvas.
