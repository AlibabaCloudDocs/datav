    In addition to conventional database configurations, you must configure the VPC ID and instance ID for the VPC database.Â Both IDs can be found in Alibaba Cloud console.

    If all the parameters are configured, the system will test the data source connection automatically.

5.  Click **OK** when the connection is verified.

You can now use the VPC database as a widget data source.
