2.  On the **Projects** tab, select an existing project and click **Edit**.

3.  Select one or more widgets.

    Press and hold the **Ctrl** key in the Windows operating system or the **command** key in macOS, and select the widgets.

4.  Drag and drop a widget in the canvas to adjust its location. Alternatively, click a widget in the Layers pane. In the right-side pane, click the **Settings** tab and change the X and Y coordinates.
