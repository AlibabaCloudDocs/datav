# Make preparations

This topic describes the preparations that you must make before you use a blank canvas to create a project.

-   [Activate DataV](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Activate DataV.md).
-   Before you create a project, you must [download](https://files.alicdn.com/tpsservice/69a16363623340b7c66658296a66b1fb.zip) and unzip the required materials, and then save the materials to your local drive.
-   The data source used in this example is a local JSON data file. Therefore, you do not need to add another data source to DataV. Instead, you can directly paste the downloaded data to the static data editor in the Configure Datasource pane. If you want to use another data source, [add a data source](/intl.en-US/Manage Data Sources/Add data sources/Overview.md) before you use a blank canvas to create a project.
