# Move the layers of widgets

This topic describes how to move the layers of widgets to lay out the widgets properly in a project.

## Function of widget layers

You can arrange the widget layers so that the widgets are well-organized in the project.

-   The higher a widget is positioned in the list, the closer it is to the front of the canvas.
-   The lower a widget is positioned in the list, the closer it is to the back of the canvas.
-   If two widgets overlap, the one in the higher position covers the other.

## Procedure

On the Layer panel or the canvas, select one or more widgets and use one of the following methods to move their layers:

-   On the top of the Layer panel, click the **Bring Forward**, **Send Backward**, **Bring to Front**, or **Sent to Back** icon.
