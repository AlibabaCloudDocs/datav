2.  On the **Projects** tab, [create a project](/intl.en-US/Manage Projects/Create a project.md) or move your pointer over an existing project and click **Edit**.

3.  In Canvas Editor, click the **Beautify Toolbox** icon in the toolbar.

    If the **Smart Themes** function is disabled, you can click ![Disable icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7435117951/p98501.jpg) or **Quick Applied** to enable this function.

5.  On the **Smart Themes** tab, configure themes as needed.

    The **Smart Themes** tab includes two tabs: **My Themes** and **Custom Themes**.

        1.  On the **My Themes** tab, click **System Themes**.

            **Warning:** The applied theme overwrites the original project configurations. Exercise caution when you perform this operation.

        4.  In the uploaded image, you can drag the color picker circle to change the theme colors. For more information, see [Custom Themes](#section_a7r_ea5_67s).
