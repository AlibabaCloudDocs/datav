# Set the filter

The DataV Toolbox allows you to set the filter. With this function, you can set filter color properties of widgets in a project. These properties include hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, and opacity.

1.  Log on to the [DataV console](https://datav.alibabacloud.com/).

2.  On the **Projects** tab, [create a project](/intl.en-US/Manage Projects/Create a project.md) or move your pointer over an existing project and click **Edit**.

3.  In Canvas Editor, click the **Toolbox** icon in the toolbar.

4.  In the upper-left corner of the canvas, turn on **Filter**.

    **Note:** When you open a new project for the first time, **Toolbox** is enabled by default. In the upper-left corner of the canvas, the **Filter** function is disabled by default. To enable this function, turn on **Filter** and configure the filter parameters.

5.  Click **Filter**.

    When you turn on **Filter** for the first time, the **Filter** pane is displayed by default. After you click an empty area in the canvas to close the pane, you need to click **Filter** again to open the **Filter** pane.

    If **Filter** is turned off, you can only view parameter settings in the Filter pane but cannot modify them.

6.  In the **Filter** pane, you can modify the settings of the parameters, such as **Hue Rotate**, **Saturation**, **Brightness**, **Contrast**, and **Opacity**.

    You can preview the filter effect of a widget in the canvas during the modification.

7.  Click **Update Settings** to apply the updated filter settings to the widget.

    **Update Settings** is dimmed by default. You can click it only after the filter settings are modified.

    **Note:** If you are not satisfied with the preview effect, click **Cancel** and reconfigure the filter. After you click **Cancel**, the **Apply** dialog box is displayed, prompting you to cancel or save the updated filter settings.
